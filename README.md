# Script for finding d223 tokens owned by all users at a block in EVM blockchain
# (CLI version)

## Running locally

Install the app's dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Set up your local environment variables by copying the example into your own `.env` file:

Your `.env` now contains the following environment variables:

- `STARTBLOCK` (placeholder) - First block (when was the first LP mint)
- `ENDBLOCK` (placeholder) - Last block.

Start app:

```bash
npm start
```

Results in **OUT** folder:
- `pd223_holders_clo.csv` - unsorted CSV version. **Rewrites on each run!**
